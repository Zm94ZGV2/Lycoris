## Hey everyone!
I'm super excited to share my first blog post with you. Here, I'll be chatting about all things tech, diving into the world of Linux, exploring Indonesian novels, and sharing my love for musicâ€”especially shoegaze. Occasionally, I might delve into English novels, and if the mood strikes, touch on programming and cybersecurity.

Please bear with me if there are any grammatical hiccups; English isn't my first language. I'm doing my best to improve, and I hope you enjoy the content!
